Intro
-----
blah

How to build
------------
Open XCode project, click build. If you want to extract the lib don't forget to define the LE_TARGET_IPHONE preprocessor macro in your project!



Current State
-------------
2011-02-13: Yay, we got particles, sound, and input. also the API structure cleared up a little. at least I have now a
			general idea in which direction the lib will go. 

2011-02-09: Well, it's unusable by now. Work is being done and it's even not clear how the API will look like.
			There's no game logic (components, etc) built in yet.
			If you need an incomplete 2d opengl lib ... now might be the time to fork it ;)
