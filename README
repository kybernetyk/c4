Intro
-----
Experimental game framework for iOS. Written in C99, features a component based entity system. Turned out to be too hard to debug because of void* and casting abuse. You can extract the 2D rendering stuff though as it's pretty much solid. (Features sprite, atlas sprite, bitmap font (support for FNT files), a particle system.)

How to build
------------
Open XCode project, click build. If you want to extract the lib don't forget to define the LE_TARGET_IPHONE preprocessor macro in your project!



Current State
-------------
2011-02-17: Project cancelled. (Too hard to debug because of void pointers and wild casting.)

2011-02-16: We've got something like scene management (with push/pop scene possibility)

2011-02-15: A simple entity system is ready. I'm still working on the API so it's not too verbose

2011-02-13: Yay, we got particles, sound, and input. also the API structure cleared up a little. at least I have now a
			general idea in which direction the lib will go. 

2011-02-09: Well, it's unusable by now. Work is being done and it's even not clear how the API will look like.
			There's no game logic (components, etc) built in yet.
			If you need an incomplete 2d opengl lib ... now might be the time to fork it ;)
